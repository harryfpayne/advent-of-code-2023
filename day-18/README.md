# Day 18
## Part 1
I spent too long on this, I tried solving it by setting all the dig points in a 2d slice, then figuring out if each point
is contained within the slice, with a cache to speed it up. Spend ages debugging it and getting it working, then when I 
got to part 2 it became clear that there is some tricky, so I moved to the shoelace algorithm.

## Part 2
Implementing shoelace was so much easier than what I was doing before so feeling quite frustrated with this.
