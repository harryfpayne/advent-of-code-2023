# Day 12
## Part 1
This was ok, I decided to not do it recursively, instead iterating through all possible permutations which turned out 
to be the wrong decision for part 2. I mainly wanted to try and implement the permutation generator based on a binary 
number counting up which was a fun exercise. 

## Part 2
I had to reimplement part 1 using recursion, so I could cache intermediate values. I can't think if there's a way to do
this with my previous solution.
