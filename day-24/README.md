# Day 24
## Part 1
This was just a lot of maths, I knew it would be something involving the cross product but spent a while looking through
wikipedia trying to get the right equation. 

## Part 2
Think this was the hardest question this year. On previous day's I've looked at reddit if I've been really stuck to 
prompt me where to go and algorithms to look for but for this I had absolutely no idea. The top reddit post for the day
gave a good description on what needed doing but even then without looking at their code I still probably would never 
have finished this question.
