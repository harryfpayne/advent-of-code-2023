# Day 21
## Part 1
This was pretty simple, just adding to a queue making sure to stop at the right point

## Part 2
I again had to look at reddit because I couldn't spot the pattern here. After realising that it grows in a quadratic 
manner I then just needed to figure out what it's value is at each stage which luckily I was already doing with a cache.
I did then cheat a bit by copying a formula which seems to calculate a quadratic given 3 points which feels a little
unsatisfying because I don't really understand how it works.
