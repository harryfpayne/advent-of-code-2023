# Advent of code 2023

I did it! This is the first year I've managed to finish every day. 

Every year I forget how difficult it gets towards the end. The last week was a slog but up until that point I enjoyed it.

## What I learned
##### Rust
In the first week or two I used rust because I want to get better at it but as time went on it became clear I needed as
little friction as possible, and being rusty (ðŸ˜‰) at the language while struggling with the implementation was just a 
step too far for this be to at all enjoyable, I still think I improved my rust and maybe I'll get further next year 
before needing to switch.

##### Priority queues
I know last year I used priority queues, but I used them much more this year and I think I much prefer them to recursion,
I ended up using them anywhere that I might have used recursion in the past.

##### Go
I got a lot more comfortable running workloads in parallel this year, I might make a library for it if I get a chance.
I think priority queues lend themselves really well to this in a way that's really difficult to do with recursion.

##### Graph algorithms
As with every year I learn more graph algorithms, this year the main ones I can think of are Minimal Cut, and using 
Dijkstra's algorithm to get the longest path.

##### Reading wikipedia
On the last few days the main struggle was finding the relevant algorithm on wikipedia which are all written in this
mathematical pseudocode which are often annoyingly difficult to translate into code, but I got better at that as the 
month (and a bit) went on.
