# Day 1
### Part 1
This was pretty easy, nothing too tricky. Every year I'm reminded how parsing the input string is the most
annoying part, especially for the earlier questions.

My solution could have been more space efficient if instead of storing all rounds when parsing the game,
just store the max color seen on each game. I decided to store all of them incase it was needed in part 2 
(turns out it wasn't needed, but it's not that big of a deal).

### Part 2
Part 2 was also really simple, just storing the highest of each number I've seen.

These early ones are useful for reminding me rust basics like methods on a struct, match cases, useful functions
for string parsing etc.
