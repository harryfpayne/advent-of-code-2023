# Day 4
### Part 1
This was quite simple, I initially thought I'd use recursion because it seemed like graph traversal which is why I used
golang, rust is quite annoying with recursion. I ended up using a map instead of traversing recursively which helped a lot
for part 2. 

### Part 2
This is tricky mainly because I spent a while trying to figure out how to figure out when the loops would all align.
To be honest I still don't fully understand how my answer worked, but it does apparently, so I'm moving on (I'm already
a few days behind).
