# Day 11
## Part 1
Pretty easy, I initially got excited I might be able to apply something I learnt at uni for efficiently calculating
the nearest pair of points, but instead it wanted us to compare every point. Had the input been larger maybe that 
optimisation would have been worthwhile but honestly doing this is taking up a lot of my time.

## Part 2
I had to refactor a bit to handle this, initially I was computing the map then getting all the points, instead
I needed to get the points earlier, realising I can add the number of preceding empty lines to every stars coordinates.
